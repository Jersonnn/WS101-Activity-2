    <ul>
      <li>I describe myself as a kind, generous and helpful person. I love music because it makes me calm and relaxed. My favorite color is blue and black. I spend most of my time playing with my cats. I love food. I enjoy coding because it allows me to create 
useful software for others. I like Linux because it is popular among
 technical users and allows for more 
customization than other operating systems.  I try my best and know how to appreciate myself for a job well done . I believe in myself. And I follow my heart.</li>

     <span style="font-size: 50px;">I Love Cats.</span><br>I adore cats because their joyful antics always bring a grin to my face and a glow of comfort to my heart. They tire themselves out playing, then jump onto my lap, purring sweetly and winning my heart.

      <span style="font-size: 50px;">I Love Coding.</span><br>
     Coding is full of that feeling. It is about breaking down a large problem into smaller sub-problems or tasks and solving them one at a time. I enjoy problem solving and having a sense of accomplishment. It's a daily pleasure for me.

    <p><img src="images/music.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 250px;""><br>
      <span style="font-size: 50px;">I Love Music</span><br>
     You get to play music with other people, and you get to play music by yourself. It’s a great refuge from the world sometimes and it’s a great way of putting a smile on someone else’s face. You play something and you give joy to somebody else. It’s great.

     <p><img src="images/food.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 250px;""><br>
       <span style="font-size: 50px;">I Love Food</span><br>
     There's nothing better than having your whole family home around the same table for dinner. Food is a catalyst that brings people together. Having the entire family together at your grandparents' house for Christmas Eve dinner or a Thanksgiving meal, treating a friend to a birthday dinner, or annual family celebrations are perfect ways to keep in touch and connect with your family and friends that you might not see regularly.

       <span style="font-size: 50px;">I Love Travel</span><br>
     There are many amazing things about traveling. You'll have the chance to try new things, meet new people, sample new foods, and learn about various cultures. Even though traveling is wonderful, most of us believe that we should put it off until we buy our cars, get that promotion, or win the lottery.
